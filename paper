Introduction
The global transition to remote work has fundamentally reshaped how project teams operate, communicate, and collaborate. While offering flexibility, cost savings, and access to a broader talent pool, remote work has also introduced a series of unintended consequences that are becoming increasingly evident. Among these, social disconnection—a state where interpersonal bonds within teams weaken due to physical separation and limited spontaneous interaction—has emerged as a critical challenge for project organizations. Social disconnection manifests through reduced engagement, lack of trust, and deteriorating team cohesion, all of which undermine project performance and stakeholder satisfaction.

In traditional in-office environments, non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, body language, and informal conversations play a crucial role in fostering trust and team rapport. Remote project teams, however, are deprived of these subtle yet powerful forms of communication. Asynchronous communication, virtual meetings, and chat-based interactions, while efficient in some contexts, often fall short in maintaining the richness of human connection required for high-performing project teams. This disconnection can lead to increased misunderstandings, lower morale, slower decision-making, and ultimately project failure.

Despite growing awareness of the issue, early detection of social disconnection remains a significant gap in current project management practices. Most interventions today are reactive—addressing issues only after they have already impacted performance. Project managers typically rely on observable behaviors or self-reported surveys to assess team health, both of which are often too late, biased, or inaccurate. Consequently, there is a pressing need for proactive and data-driven mechanisms that can signal the early onset of disconnection and allow for timely intervention.

This research proposes an innovative solution at the intersection of wearable sensing technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). By capturing real-time physiological and behavioral data—such as heart rate variability, stress indicators, speech patterns, and interaction frequency—we aim to develop a framework that can identify early signals of social disconnection among remote team members. This data, when processed using machine learning models, offers the potential to uncover patterns invisible to the human eye, enabling a more nuanced understanding of team dynamics in digital project environments.

The proposed study is guided by the following research questions:

How can physiological and behavioral data be used to detect early signs of social disconnection in remote project teams?

What AI-driven techniques are most effective in modeling and predicting changes in interpersonal bonding in virtual environments?

How can an adaptive project organization model leverage these insights to intervene and strengthen team cohesion in real time?

By answering these questions, this research seeks to contribute to the evolving field of AI-enhanced project management through the development of an adaptive organizational model tailored for remote work environments. This model will not only provide early warnings of potential team dysfunctions but also recommend or trigger personalized, context-sensitive interventions aimed at restoring trust, engagement, and collaboration.

The contributions of this study are both theoretical and practical. Theoretically, it advances our understanding of the relationship between human physiological responses, behavioral signals, and social dynamics in virtual project teams. Practically, it provides project managers, PMOs, and digital collaboration platforms with a scalable tool to support human-centric, resilient project work in increasingly digital and decentralized settings.

In doing so, this research addresses a growing void in project management literature and practice, responding directly to calls for innovative, AI-driven solutions that support the human side of project delivery. As remote work continues to be a defining feature of modern project environments, developing intelligent systems that preserve and strengthen interpersonal bonds will be essential to sustaining team performance, well-being, and long-term organizational success.




Literature Review
Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into project management has emerged as a transformative force, particularly in remote work environments. As project teams increasingly rely on digital tools for communication and coordination, there is a growing need to understand how AI technologies can support not only technical tasks but also interpersonal relationships and team cohesion. The literature reveals that while AI has advanced project productivity and decision-making, its role in mitigating social disconnection remains underexplored. Furthermore, interdisciplinary insights from behavioral science, wearable technology, and data analytics highlight new opportunities to detect early signs of disengagement in remote teams. This literature review explores four key areas: AI in project management (including Generative AI and Explainable AI), human–AI collaboration in digital project teams, the challenge of social disconnection in virtual environments, and the application of wearable sensing for behavior monitoring.

AI in Project Management: GenAI and XAI
AI is rapidly becoming an integral component of modern project management, with applications in risk analysis, scheduling, resource allocation, and stakeholder engagement (Bento et al., 2022; Taboada et al., 2023). In particular, Generative AI (GenAI) and Explainable AI (XAI) represent two of the most promising advancements. GenAI facilitates content creation and simulation, enabling project managers to generate draft project plans, risk scenarios, and communication templates rapidly (Barcaui & Monat, 2023; Epstein et al., 2023). These capabilities offer a significant reduction in planning time and allow human experts to focus on strategic oversight.

Conversely, XAI aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable. This is especially important in project settings where decisions must be accountable and stakeholder trust is critical (Arrieta et al., 2020; Gunning et al., 2019). In complex projects, black-box AI tools can alienate users and lead to resistance, particularly if stakeholders do not understand how decisions are made. XAI tools facilitate user trust by explaining predictions, highlighting data features, and offering rationale behind recommendations (Chalutz-Ben Gal, 2023). This alignment of AI outputs with project transparency enhances governance and accountability.

Holzmann et al. (2022) emphasized that AI is not just a support tool but a strategic enabler in managing complexity. The Project Management Institute (PMI, 2024b) has also projected that AI capabilities will redefine the role of the project manager, shifting focus from manual tracking to decision orchestration and stakeholder interaction. However, these benefits must be evaluated alongside the ethical risks posed by bias, job displacement, and misuse of data (Bryson, 2020; Shaw, 2019).

Human–AI Collaboration in Digital Project Environments
The conversation is evolving from AI versus humans to AI with humans. The concept of coproduction in digital work environments advocates for synergy between human judgment and machine efficiency (Trist, 1981; Feuerriegel et al., 2024). In project teams, this collaboration is particularly valuable when AI can supplement, rather than replace, human capabilities. For example, AI systems can continuously scan project signals to alert managers about potential schedule delays, while humans assess the contextual and relational implications of such signals.

This division of labor between AI and humans raises questions about autonomy, trust, and design ethics (Epstein et al., 2023). Designers of AI project tools must consider user agency and ensure systems are not overly prescriptive. According to Nilsson (2024), adoption of AI in project teams requires a strong cultural shift that supports experimentation and learning. This is supported by Svanberg et al. (2024), who found that teams using AI systems with explainable outputs reported higher satisfaction and better task performance.

Nonetheless, challenges persist. Arslan et al. (2022) noted that interpersonal trust may diminish when AI is perceived to dominate decision-making. Similarly, Birkstedt et al. (2023) warned of governance gaps in AI deployment within organizations, which can lead to accountability vacuums. These findings emphasize the importance of building AI systems that are not only effective but also human-centric, interpretable, and ethically aligned with the goals of project management.

Team Dynamics and Social Disconnection in Remote Work
Team cohesion is an essential factor in project success, influencing communication, innovation, and conflict resolution. Remote work environments, however, create barriers to developing interpersonal bonds. The absence of informal interactions and non-verbal cues limits opportunities to build trust and mutual understanding (Huemann, 2022). This challenge is further exacerbated by asynchronous communication and digital fatigue, which can lead to emotional detachment, miscommunication, and disengagement.

Social disconnection in remote teams is not merely a byproduct of distance but a deeper psychosocial phenomenon that affects collaboration and productivity (Sharma, 2023). Disconnected team members may begin to underperform, avoid interaction, or become resistant to feedback, yet these signs often go unnoticed by project leaders. Traditional tools such as engagement surveys or one-on-one check-ins are reactive and infrequent, failing to capture the dynamic nature of team interactions.

Arslan et al. (2022) argue that AI, when used responsibly, can help bridge these gaps by monitoring communication frequency, sentiment, and response times. Still, such approaches must be complemented by human insight to avoid reducing complex emotional states to oversimplified metrics. There is a need for real-time, nuanced monitoring systems that respect privacy while offering actionable insights into team health. This calls for integration with biometric and behavioral data—domains where wearable sensing technologies can play a transformative role.

Wearable Sensors and Physiological Monitoring
Wearable sensors are increasingly used in healthcare and sports to track stress, sleep, and cardiovascular function, but their application in workplace and project settings is emerging. Devices that monitor heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance, and body temperature can offer reliable indicators of stress, engagement, and emotional response (Colombo et al., 2019). In project teams, these indicators could signal early stages of burnout, disconnection, or low engagement—long before such states become behaviorally visible.

Johnson et al. (2021) emphasized that physiological monitoring, when combined with AI-driven analytics, can help organizations detect workforce patterns, predict well-being risks, and support tailored interventions. The Foldit experiment (Koepnick et al., 2019) illustrated how human–AI collaboration can be optimized by aligning algorithmic strengths with human intuition—a principle applicable to emotional monitoring in teams.

Despite the promise, ethical concerns about data privacy, surveillance, and consent must be addressed (Etzioni & Etzioni, 2017). Organizations must develop clear policies on how such data is collected, stored, and used. Transparent communication and opt-in mechanisms are essential to avoid undermining trust.

Nevertheless, the potential benefits are substantial. Integrated into collaboration tools or project dashboards, wearable data could provide real-time insights for project managers to identify declining morale, interpersonal tension, or cognitive overload. When paired with AI, these insights can trigger adaptive interventions—ranging from restructuring task assignments to initiating peer check-ins or social breaks.

Transition and Research Gap
The literature underscores that AI and wearable technologies have the potential to significantly enhance project execution, human-AI collaboration, and workforce well-being. However, a critical gap remains in integrating physiological and behavioral data into project management systems to support early detection and mitigation of social disconnection in remote work settings. Current models primarily focus on technical performance, neglecting the emotional and relational dynamics that underpin effective teamwork.

This research seeks to fill that gap by developing an adaptive, AI-enabled project organization model that proactively identifies signs of social disconnection using multimodal data inputs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of wearable sensing and machine learning, the proposed framework aims to strengthen interpersonal bonds, enhance remote team cohesion, and support human-centric project success in digital environments.
